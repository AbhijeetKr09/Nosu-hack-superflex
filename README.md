## 🔥 Why Superflex AI?  
Developing in **React** can sometimes be **complex**, especially for beginners. But with **@SuperflexAI**, the process was **smooth, fast, and effortless**:  
✅ **Quickly understood prompts** and requirements.  
✅ **Direct Figma integration**—imported designs with ease.  
✅ **Image-to-code support** for seamless development.  
✅ **Minimal explanations needed**—AI-generated components fit perfectly!  
✅ **Best when you generate code component wise** - you can give it complete design at once but for better accuracy you can explain ai component by component
✅ **best when used all three at once** - if you use image explaination as i gave with a little prompt for understanding image and design from the figma it better understand the requirements.

Superflex AI eliminated the **usual coding struggles**, making front-end dev feel like magic! ✨
